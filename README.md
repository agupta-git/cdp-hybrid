# cdp-hybrid - ROUGH NOTES - WIP
Hybrid features that we support in this use case - 
- Develop once, run anywhere. Single code base, multiple uses.
- De-risk cloud migration. Migrate apps independently instead of doing whole lift & shift.
- Add cloud workloads/features to existing on-prem data pipelines. This prevents disruption to existing business. Avoids duplication of data pipelines.
- ToDo later - Add Denodo partner & build virtual views on on-prem & cloud tables.
